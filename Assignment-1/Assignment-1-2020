First, design a 2:1 Multiplexer in Verilog. Next, implement a 4:1 Multiplexer using the modules that you have developed for 2:1 Multiplexer. Further, repeat this hierarchical design procedure to design 8:1 and 16:1 Multiplexer using multiple instantiations of the 4:1 and 8:1 multiplexer modules, respectively. Come up with proper interfaces of your multiplexer designs. Finally, instantiate this 16:1 multiplexer in a proper Verilog testbench and to simulate it. Submit a single zipped folder with your Verilog files only.
